A JavaScript mangler/compressor toolkit for ES6+.

*note*: <s>You can support this project on patreon: [link]</s> **The Terser Patreon is shutting down in favor of opencollective**. Check out [PATRONS.md](https://github.com/terser/terser/blob/master/PATRONS.md) for our first-tier patrons.

Terser recommends you use RollupJS to bundle your modules, as that produces smaller code overall.

*Beautification* has been undocumented and is *being removed* from terser, we recommend you use [prettier](https://npmjs.com/package/prettier).

Why choose terser?

`uglify-es` is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/3156#issuecomment-392943058) and `uglify-js` does not support ES6+.

**`terser`** is a fork of `uglify-es` that mostly retains API and CLI compatibility
with `uglify-es` and `uglify-js@3`.
